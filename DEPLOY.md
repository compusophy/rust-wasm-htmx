# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your application is ready for Railway deployment! Here's what's configured:

- ✅ **Node.js Express Server** - Serves HTML, CSS, JS, and API endpoints
- ✅ **Rust WASM Module** - 32x32 grid game with high-performance calculations
- ✅ **HTMX Integration** - Dynamic content updates
- ✅ **Production Build Process** - Automatic WASM compilation
- ✅ **Railway Configuration** - `railway.toml` and `nixpacks.toml` ready
- ✅ **Port Configuration** - Uses Railway's assigned PORT environment variable

## 🎯 What Will Be Deployed

The deployed application includes:
- 🏠 **Home Page** (`/`) - WASM demos + WebSocket features + Play button
- 🎮 **Game Page** (`/play`) - Interactive 32x32 grid powered by Rust WASM
- 🔄 **API Endpoints** - `/api/time`, `/api/echo`, `/api/wasm-result`

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: GitHub + Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment 🚀"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Start a New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will automatically detect and build!

### Option 2: Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

## 🔧 Railway Build Process

Railway will automatically:

1. **Detect Languages**: Node.js + Rust
2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - Node.js packages via `npm ci`
   - Rust toolchain + wasm-pack
3. **Build WASM**: `npm run build` (compiles Rust to WebAssembly)
4. **Start Server**: `npm run start:production`

## 🌐 Post-Deployment

After deployment, you'll get a public URL like:
- `https://your-app-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

Test these features:
- ✅ Home page loads with WASM demos
- ✅ Click "🎮 Play Game" → 32x32 grid works
- ✅ Grid cells toggle on click
- ✅ Pattern buttons work (Checkerboard, Cross, Border)
- ✅ HTMX endpoints work (Time, Echo)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- **WASM build fails**: Check Rust toolchain availability
- **Dependencies missing**: Ensure `nixpacks.toml` includes required packages

### Runtime Issues
- **Port errors**: Railway automatically assigns PORT, no manual config needed
- **WASM not loading**: Check if `pkg/` directory exists after build

### Common Solutions
```bash
# Rebuild WASM locally to test
npm run build:rust

# Test production build locally
npm run start:production

# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Cold Start**: ~30-60 seconds (initial deployment)
- **Warm Requests**: <200ms response time
- **WASM Grid**: Instant cell updates
- **Memory Usage**: ~50-100MB

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Railway automatically sets:
- `PORT` - Server port (don't override)
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production mode

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your Rust WASM + HTMX application will be live and accessible worldwide!
